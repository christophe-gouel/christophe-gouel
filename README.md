I am a researcher at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (Paris-Saclay, France). I study agricultural commodity markets and international trade. I am committed to open and reproducible science. You can find all replication materials of my recent work on my [Dataverse](https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataverse/christophe-gouel) and of my older work on my [webpage](http://www.christophegouel.com/papers.html).

On my GitHub, you can find a few public projects related to [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/45/docs/UG_Parameters.html#UG_Parameters_ScalarAssignments), which I use to build trade models, and to the storage model, a workhorse model of commodity market which requires specific numerical methods to be solved, and [my emacs configuration](https://github.com/christophe-gouel/dotemacs).

### GAMS-related projects

- **[GAMS Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/christophe-gouel/GAMS-Cheat-Sheet)** provides most useful GAMS commands in 2 pages to facilitate GAMS learning.
- **[GAMS Style Guide](https://github.com/christophe-gouel/gams-style-guide)** provides a complete style guide for writing GAMS programs.
- **[gamsr](https://github.com/christophe-gouel/gamsr)** is a R package to interact with GAMS (read GDX files and launch GAMS scripts).
- **[Modern GAMS teaching - GAMS with GitHub Classroom](https://github.com/economic-modeling-master/gams-blog)** is a blog post about how to use GitHub Classroom for teaching GAMS.
- I contribute to the **[Emacs GAMS mode](https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/gams-mode)**, the package that allows to work with GAMS files in Emacs.

### Storage model

- **[Shiny storage](https://github.com/christophe-gouel/shiny-storage)** is a Shiny application that provides an interactive graphical representation of a simple storage model. I use it for teaching this model in graduate classes.
- **[RECS](https://github.com/christophe-gouel/RECS)** is a MATLAB solver allowing to solve rational expectations models with complementarity constraints, such as the storage model. It is no longer maintained but should still work on Windows.
- **[Storage estimation](https://github.com/christophe-gouel/storage-estimation)** is a repository containing various classical estimation and solution methods (in MATLAB and R) for the storage model. Could be useful to those wanting to replicate old papers or starting in the field. I have not touched this repo in the last 10 years, so do not except any support.
